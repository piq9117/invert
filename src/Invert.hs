{- $overview

There are three considerations when you're inverting a function:

  1. Is it an injection, a surjection, both (a bijection), or neither?
  2. What data structure do you want to use for efficient lookups?
  3. Can you produce a list of all values in the function's domain?

=== 1. What sort of function do you have?

This question determines the type of the function's inverse.

For a function @(a -> b)@, we call @(a)@ its /domain/, and @(b)@ its /codomain/.

  * In general, when you invert a 'function' of type @(a -> b)@,
    the type of the inverse is @(b -> [a])@.
    The result is a list because it contains all domain values that
    map to a given codomain value; there may be none, one, or many.

  * If your function @(a -> b)@ is a 'bijection',
    you can invert it to get a function @(b -> a)@.
    Bijections are quite pleasing in this way.

  * If no two domain values map to the same codomain value,
    then your function is an 'injection',
    and it has an inverse of type @(b -> 'Maybe' a)@.

  * If every codomain value has some domain value that maps to it,
    then your function is a 'surjection',
    and it has an inverse of type @(b -> 'NonEmpty' a)@.

You are responsible for determining which is appropriate for a particular
situation: 'function', 'bijection', 'injection', or 'surjection'.
Choose carefully; the wrong choice may produce an inverse which is
partial or incorrect.

=== 2. How can we produce a reasonably efficient inversion?

The simplest inversion strategies, 'linearSearchLazy' and 'linearSearchStrict',
apply the function to each element of the domain, one by one.
We call this a /linear search/ because the time required for each
application has a linear correspondence with the size of the domain.

  * 'linearSearchStrict' works by precomputing a strict sequence
    of tuples, one for each value of the domain.

  * 'linearSearchLazy' precomputes nothing at all.
    It is possible to use this stategy when the domain is infinite.

Our other two strategies, 'binarySearch' and 'hashTable',
work by building data structures that allow more efficient lookups.

  * 'binarySearch' precomputes a binary search tree;
    the codomain must belong to the 'Ord' class.

  * 'hashTable' precomputers a hash table;
    the codomain must belong to the 'Hashable' class.

The 'Hashable' class comes from "Data.Hashable" in the @hashable@ package.
The class is re-exported by "Invert", which you may find convenient if
your primary motivation for deriving 'Hashable' is to invert a function.

=== 3. How will you enumerate the domain?

Inverting a function @(a -> b)@ requires having a list of all
possible values of domain @(a)@; from this, we can apply the
function to every value to produce a list of tuples that
completely describes the function.

We offer two suggestions for automatically producing this list:

  * 'enumBounded' uses two stock-derivable classes, 'Enum' and 'Bounded'.
  * 'genum' uses GHC generics; it requires deriving 'Generic' and 'GEnum'.

The 'Generic' class comes from "GHC.Generics", and the 'GEnum' class
comes from "Generics.Deriving" in the @generic-deriving@ package.
Both classes are re-exported by "Invert", which you may find convenient
if your primary motivation for deriving 'GEnum' is to invert a function.

    An inversion strategy is an approach for producing
    the inverse of an @(a -> b)@ function.

    All strategies produce the same results, but they
    have operational differences that affect performance.

    The "Invert" module provides several strategies.
    If you want to design your own, use either
    'strategyAll' or 'strategyOneAndAll'.
